#### Stylite (Student Project Third Semester @S4G)
- Turn and Tile based Game in which the player is able to combine spells and modifiers to fight enemies
- You're also able to download it at: https://s4g.itch.io/stylite

#### My Tasks
- Ai, Ui implementation (only scripts), and the Spellsystem
- I also implemented the Resource management in the second commit, but that got cut after 4 weeks.
